## My ML & DS toolbox

### This repository contains some of ML algorithms implemented from scratch with powerful numpy library under Python3.

Available ML models include:

1. Expectation Maximization with Gaussian Mixture that performs clustering on data set with unknown labels.
   It only supports diagonal covariance meaniang std length is same along different feature directions. 

2. K-neirest neighbour classification algorithm including cross validation with bagging. Bagging is
   performed by resampling 50% with replacement, where n_bags can be passed as argument.  

3. Decision Tree Regression

4. Random Tree Regression

5. Random Forest ( Random Tree combined with Bagging)

6. Linear Regression

7. Logistic Regression Classifier (linear case) with GD and SGD
