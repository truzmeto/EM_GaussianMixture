## My implementation of so ML algorithms

### This repository contains some of ML algorithmsi implemented with python3 out of curiosity.

Currently it has:

1. Expectation Maximization with Gaussian Mixture that performes clustering on data set with unknown labels.
   It only supports diagonal covariance meaniang std length is same along different feature directions. 

2. K-neirest neighbour including cross validation
