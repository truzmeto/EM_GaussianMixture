## Expectation Maximization via Gaussian Mixture

This code represents Expectation Maximization with Gaussian Mixture in order to
performe clustering the data set with unknown labels. It is developed with python3. Currently, 
it only supports diagonal covariance meaniang std length is same along different feature directions.
